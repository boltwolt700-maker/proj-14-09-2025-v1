# ðŸš¨ FIX: Database Error - column u.first_name does not exist

## The Problem

You're getting this error because there are views in your database that are trying to access `u.first_name` and `u.last_name` from the `auth.users` table, but these columns don't exist there. They should be accessing the `user_profiles` table instead.

**Error:** `ERROR: 42703: column u.first_name does not exist`

## The Solution

You need to apply the fix migration that corrects the problematic views. Here's how:

### Step 1: Apply the Main Schema Migration (if not done yet)

First, make sure you've applied the main schema migration:

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project: `lptwmxggbpinmqgjkedi`
3. Click "SQL Editor" â†’ "New query"
4. Copy and paste the content from: `supabase/migrations/20250828000000_complete_schema.sql`
5. Click "Run"

### Step 2: Apply the Fix Migration

Now apply the fix for the problematic views:

1. In the same SQL Editor, click "New query"
2. Copy and paste the content from: `supabase/migrations/20250828000001_fix_dashboard_view.sql`
3. Click "Run"

### Alternative: Direct SQL Fix

If you prefer, here's the direct SQL to fix the issue:

```sql
-- Fix for user_dashboard_summary view - correct column references
-- This migration fixes the error: column u.first_name does not exist

-- Drop the problematic view first
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS user_dashboard_summary;

-- Recreate the view with correct column references
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW user_dashboard_summary AS
SELECT 
  u.id as user_id,
  u.email,
  up.first_name,
  up.last_name,
  up.industry,
  up.experience_level,
  up.primary_goal,
  -- Latest brand scores
  (SELECT overall_score FROM brand_analyses WHERE user_id = u.id ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1) as current_brand_score,
  (SELECT visibility_score FROM brand_analyses WHERE user_id = u.id ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1) as current_visibility_score,
  (SELECT engagement_score FROM brand_analyses WHERE user_id = u.id ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1) as current_engagement_score,
  -- Goals summary
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_goals WHERE user_id = u.id AND is_completed = FALSE) as active_goals_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_goals WHERE user_id = u.id AND is_completed = TRUE) as completed_goals_count,
  -- Insights summary
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mentor_insights WHERE user_id = u.id AND is_read = FALSE) as unread_insights_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM mentor_insights WHERE user_id = u.id) as total_insights_count,
  -- LinkedIn integration status
  (SELECT is_active FROM linkedin_integrations WHERE user_id = u.id) as linkedin_connected,
  (SELECT last_synced_at FROM linkedin_integrations WHERE user_id = u.id) as last_linkedin_sync,
  -- Achievement count
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_achievements WHERE user_id = u.id) as total_achievements
FROM auth.users u
LEFT JOIN user_profiles up ON up.user_id = u.id;

-- Grant access to the view
GRANT SELECT ON user_dashboard_summary TO authenticated;

-- RLS policy for the view
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own dashboard summary" ON user_dashboard_summary;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own dashboard summary"
  ON user_dashboard_summary FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

## What This Fix Does

1. **Drops the problematic view** that was trying to access non-existent columns
2. **Recreates the view** with correct column references from `user_profiles` table
3. **Fixes the JOIN** to properly connect `auth.users` with `user_profiles`
4. **Updates the column references** to use `up.first_name` instead of `u.first_name`

## Verification

After applying the fix:

1. **Check the view**: Go to "Table Editor" â†’ "Views" in Supabase Dashboard
2. **Test a query**: Try running `SELECT * FROM user_dashboard_summary LIMIT 1;`
3. **Test your application**: Try signing up a new user and accessing the dashboard

## Why This Happened

The original migration files had views that assumed `first_name` and `last_name` were columns in the `auth.users` table, but in Supabase:
- `auth.users` only contains basic authentication data (id, email, etc.)
- Custom user data like `first_name`, `last_name` should be in the `user_profiles` table
- The views needed to be updated to properly JOIN these tables

## Next Steps

After applying this fix:

1. âœ… **Database error resolved** - No more "column u.first_name does not exist" errors
2. âœ… **Views work correctly** - Dashboard views will show proper user data
3. âœ… **Application works** - Users can sign up and access the dashboard
4. âœ… **All features functional** - AI Mentor features will work properly

Your application should now work without any database errors!
